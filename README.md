# sampling
sampling_assignment_102003472
for balancing the dataset --> used undersampling
                          --> also tried oversampling









for sampling used 5 methods --> 1. simple
                            --> 2. startified
                            --> 3. clustered
                            --> 4. systematic
                            --> 5. convenience
                            
                            
                            
                            
                    
                            
                            
                      
ML models --> 1. Random forest 
          --> 2. decision tree
          --> 3. KNN
          --> 4. Logistic
          --> 5. SVC
